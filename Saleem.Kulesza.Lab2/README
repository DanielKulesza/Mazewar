How to play the game:
- First go to Saleem.Kulesza.Lab2/

- Compile all files
	make

- Start server with
	java Server <port number>

- Start 4 Mazewar clients (with unique names)
	java Mazewar <ip address> <port number>
- Play the game

Fixes:
1) Packet ordering:
	We added priority blocking queues on both server and client listener threads to keep ordering on incoming packets befor executing the events

2) Hidden bug:
   -	Bullets colliding but didn't disappear on all GUIs. This was fixed by making sure bullets were only moved if they haven't already been destroyed.
   -	Bullets being moved individually on each client caused incosistency in the location of the bullets on different GUIs. This was fixed by syncronizing bullet movements with the server sending a packet to move them to all clients. We created a thread (MoveProjectileThread) to send this packet through the server every 200 milliseconds

3)Respawn orientation:
	Changed respawn orientation to  be fixed to North instead of randomn directions as they were different on different GUIs.

4)Changed max players to 4
